Summarising, I've made an update to my app with ENABLE_DISPLAY_LINK_PAUSING 0. 

Also I updated Unity version to 2022.2.1f1. 

And started getting lots of `linearize_waiters` crashes on iOS. 

Then with next update I also did ENABLE_RUNLOOP_ACCEPT_INPUT 0 with no any other changes made to the app. And now crash count dropped 10x but still getting them.
